# Programming and Scripting Exercises 2018
Exercises submitted by David Sheils for the Programming and Scripting Module, HDip in Data Analytics


## How to run these scripts
These scripts are written in Python. Users will need to have installed Python 3.6 on their machines. For these particular scripts, no specialised packages (e.g NumPy) are required.

## Exercises and script files

#### Exercises 1 and 2
For the first exercise, students were give an example program that calculated the 30th Fibonacci number. Students were asked to  alter the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of his/her first name as numbers. Students were required to please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per Dr. McLoughlins post there. In addition, students were required to add the answer to Exercise 1 to the text of the program to be created in response to Excercise2.

For exercise 2, students were given a link to sample program (https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python-fib/blob/master/fibname.py) and asked to change the string variable to contain your their own surname, and rerun it. They were also asked to find out what the ord() function does. The output of the program, along with students' understanding of the ord() function to the discussions forum.
In addition, students were required to add the answer to Exercise 1 to the text of the program to be created in response to Excercise2.

The file fibonacci.py provides the responses to Exercise 1 and 2 as requested. https://github.com/davesheils/ProgrammingScriptingExercises2018/blob/master/Fibonacci.py

#### Exercise 3
Students were required to write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. It was also suggested that, in order to enhance the program, the user should be able to input the stating number. 

The code for Exercise3 is in the file CollatzConjecture.py (https://github.com/davesheils/ProgrammingScriptingExercises2018/blob/master/CollatzConjecture.py)

#### Exercise 4

Students were required to write a script to solve problem 5 from Project Euler. The problem is as follows. 2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Specifically, students were required to write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.

The response to this exercise is contained in the file Euler5.py. https://github.com/davesheils/ProgrammingScriptingExercises2018/blob/master/Euler5.py

Note: We were required to use for and range to solve Euler 5. This program performs this task, but I do acknowledge that the brute force algorithm used is not the most effient way of solving this problem.


#### Exercise 5

Students were required to write Python script that reads the Iris data set in and print the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.

To run this program, the user should create a sub-directory called Data in their working directory. They should download the Iris dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) and store in the Data sub-directory. 


#### Exercise 6

Students were required to write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. Students were requried to test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
